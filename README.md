# GraphicSVG: Beautiful vector graphics in Elm
Create beautiful graphics and animations in your browser. Build your graphics and animations by composing 
and transforming basic shapes. Create beautiful full-page Elm apps with the power of the Elm Architecture, 
or embed our graphics into your existing `elm/Html` projects.

## Learn and create
Simple to pick up and learn, GraphicSVG has been used to successfully introduce over 15,000 K-12 students to
programming in a fun, easy-to-learn way as part of McMaster's [Software: A Tool For Change](http://outreach.mcmaster.ca 
"Outreach Homepage") program. We've been blown away by the work of our students, showcased in our [Hall of Fame](http://outreach.mcmaster.ca/showcase.html) and student-created [Science Odyssey 2018 Reading Games](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~anand/SciOdy2018.html).

We have developed several resources for teaching using GraphicSVG, including:
- [Interactive "ShapeCreate" Tool](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~anand/ShapeCreate2.html)
- [`gameApp` examples](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~anand/examples/)
- [Bite-sized "Cool Demos"](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~anand/CoolDemos/)

## Get started today!
